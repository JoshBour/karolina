// layout

// generic site styles. this includes site chrome styles
// such as the header, footer, flash messages, nav, as well
// as common patterns used around the site like forms, type,
// links, etc. the loose idea is that you could take these
// styles and create a similar "layout" but it wouldn't
// include contextual patterns like books, originals, etc.

// modules

// elements used on multiple pages that are loosely tied
// to our domain and data structure. examples are dependent
// on the needs of your site. as a general guideline, all
// modules should be used on multiple pages. elements used
// on a single page should be included in views.

// views

// elements used on a single page. these styles are
// often needed to help put finishing touches on a
// page where modules didn't quite line up perfectly,
// or where a page has completely unique elements.
// these styles could often be abstracted to modules
// but lack a reason to do so. keeping them here helps
// explain their singular usage.
